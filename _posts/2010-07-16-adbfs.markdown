Android Debug Bridge (ADB) in action

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is usually used for debugging Android devices. I personally use it to move files around because mounting your SD card can sometimes be a hassle. Moving files around in the command line isn't fun either; imagine typing the following:

```shell
adb push bla /sdcard/ultRa\ Long\ Directory/AnOther\ Long\Directory/bla
```

Not fun... So to solve this problem, I wrote ADBFS. With ADBFS, I can simply drag and drop files as usual.

# Requirements
*nix OS (or any OS that supports FUSE – I think Windows has a port, not sure)
FUSE (macFUSE for Mac users – for Windows, I don't know)
Android SDK from the Android Developers site
Git

# Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:isieo/adbFS.git .
cd adbFS
make
mv adbfs <location of Android SDK>/tools/adbfs
```


# Usage

```
mkdir ~/mounted-adb
adbfs mounted-adb

```

Done! Enjoy drag and drop without needing to "mount" your SD card to your machine.

Note: ADBFS can be very slow at times. This is because your file manager is trying to access all the files to get data from it. ADB was never designed to do this, so it's not fast. Also, this program is a proof-of-concept. If anyone has a better implementation, please suggest.

# WARNING
Very experimental =P it's usable though; I use this regularly to modify my playlist file.
