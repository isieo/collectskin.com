![The burnt down Fridge](/images/20230930/fridgeburnt.jpg)

It was Thursday 1:30AM (+- few mins) i was in my room watching some TV series.
I smelled something burning, my initial though was my pc was overheating and something burnt - i went to my pc and smelled it, nope not my pc..
That was when i opened my room door and all i could see was complete darkness, it was like you no-cliped in to a different dimension - it was black smoke.

I shouted "FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!" to wake everyone up, opened my room's window to let the smoke dicipate. as i reached downstairs, i felt the heat coming from our 
kitchen. The fridge was on fire! luckily we had 2 bottles portable Fire Extinguishers. We started spraying the fridge with the fire extinguisers and tried our best to not inhale
smoke. Once the fire subsided (we can still hear ambers crackeling inside the fridge), We turn off the Electrical Breaker and hosed down the fridge and its surrounding with water.

We managed to put out the fire before the Fire Department Arrived, according to the fire department, we are lucky that we acted quick or the house would have been burnt down within 15mins.

## Aftermath - Soot.. Soot everywhere!

Holy shiet, almost everying in the house is blanketed by a layer of soot, our dining room now looks like some hipster's cafe with those gradient paint.
Cleaning was insane too, My air conditioner's filter was clogged up with black soot.

The first thing i did in the morning was to purchase a new smoke alarm - realized that our old one doesn't work anymore... 

## The Fridge

Our theory of how a fridge can catch on fire was that the automatic ice maker's motor got over heated and started the fire in ice maker compartment.
The ice maker compartment was fully melted and chared.

The fire must have started from the icemaker mechanism then spread to the door where it started burning the insulation material...

Forunately, no one was injured in this incident.
